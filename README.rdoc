Considerations:
 I've chosen rails because it's easier to prototype. If this was a productive API I'd go with grape probably.
 There is no api versioning due to its simplicity.
 Developed with TDD
 Tests can be less repetitive by using FactoryGirl.
 Admins can perform customer actions.
 I had no time to write model tests.
